    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment or foil.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon just starts to flake easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly before breaking up into small pieces. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine rice, water, and remaining salt in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil, stir once, reduce heat to low, and cover.</li>
        <li>Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and fluff with a fork.  Stir in rice vinegar and let cool. </li>
        <li>When salmon is cooled, add it to a bowl with crab, cream cheese, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha, and soy sauce, and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; add rice and press into an even layer. Crush nori sheets over rice and sprinkle with furikake.</li>
        <li>Spread salmon mixture over seaweed; sprinkle evenly with everything seasoning. </li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until browned around the edges, about 25 minutes. </li>
